 * If the board has extra hardware serials in addition to the default hardware
 * serial port that is connected to the USB/Serial converter, we will use that
 * on the default pins. We do this when RFQUACK_LOG_SS_DISABLE (disable the
 * software serial logging output) is defined, which means that the user would
 * like to use the hardware serial to get the logging output.
 *
 * Else, if the software serial pins are defined and RFQUACK_LOG_SS_DISABLED is
 * not defined, then the user wants to use them to receive serial logging data.
 *
 * Otherwise, if the primary hardware serial (that is usually connected to the
 * USB/Serial converter) is not taken by the transport, then we use that one
 * for logging.
 *
 * If none of these cases apply, we just redirect the logging output to a
 * software serial with default pins as defined in config/logging.h
 *
 * Overall the user can have:
 *
 *  - serial transport (via the USB/Serial converter port), plus logging via:
 *    - via software serial: they must not define RFQUACK_LOG_SS_DISABLED
 *    - via hardware serial: they must define RFQUACK_LOG_SS_DISABLED and have a board that has a Serial1 hardware serial
 *
 *  - other (non-serial) transport, they will get the logging via the USB/Serial converter port
